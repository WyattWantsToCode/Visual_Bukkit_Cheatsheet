# Plugin Components
## What is a Plugin Component
A Plugin Component is like the starting point or the trigger for everything else after the Plugin Component block.

The Plugin Component is the 
```
[Bukkit] Command =>
    Name: broadcast
    Description: sends message to all players
```
and when the Command is triggered the 
```
[Bukkit] Broadcast Message =>
    Message: This message goes to everyone
```
is sent
